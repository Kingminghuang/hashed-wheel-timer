# What is the Hashed Timer?

Hashed and Hierarchical Wheels were used as a base for Kernels and Network stacks, and
were described by the [freebsd](http://people.freebsd.org/~davide/asia/callout_paper.pdf),
[linux people](http://lwn.net/Articles/156329/),
[researchers](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nahum/w6998/papers/ton97-timing-wheels.pdf) and
in many other searches.

Many modern Java frameworks have their own implementations of Timing Wheels, for example,
[Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/HashedWheelTimer.java),
[Agrona](https://github.com/real-logic/Agrona/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/co/real_logic/agrona/TimerWheel.java),
[Reactor](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/master/src/main/java/reactor/core/timer/HashWheelTimer.java),
[Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/utils/timer/Timer.scala)
and many others. Of course, every implementation is adapted for the needs of the particular
framework.

The concept on the Timer Wheel is rather simple to understand: in order to keep track
of events on given resolution, an array of linked lists (alternatively - sets or even
arrays, YMMV) is preallocated. When event is scheduled, it's address is found by
dividing deadline time `t` by `resolution` and `wheel size`.

It is often called __approximated timer__, since it acts on the certain resolution, which
allows optimisation. All the tasks scheduled for the timer period lower than the resolution
or "between" resolution steps will be rounded to the "ceiling" (for example, given resolution
10 milliseconds, all the tasks for 5,6,7 etc milliseconds will first fire after 10, and
15, 16, 17 will first trigger after 20).

This implementation was contributed to Reactor in [2014](https://github.com/reactor/reactor/commit/53c0dcfab40b91838694843729c85c2effe7272b),
and now is extracted and adopted to be used as a standalone library with benchmarks,
`debounce`, `throttle` implementations, `ScheduledExecutorService` impl and
other bells and whistles. For __buckets__, `ConcurrentHashSet` is used (this, however,
does not have any influence on the cancellation performance, it is still `O(1)` as
cancellation is handled during bucket iteration). Switching to the array didn't bring
change performance / throughput at all (however, reduced the memory footprint). Array
implementation is however harder to get right, as one would have to allow multiple
strategies for growth and shrinking of the underlying array.

Advancement would be to implement a hierarchical wheels, which would be quite simple
on top of this library.

# nanoTime

Internally, this library is using `nanoTime`, since it's a system timer (exactly
what the library needs) best used for measuring elapsed time, exactly as JDK documentation
states. One of the places to read about `nanoTime` is [here](http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/nanotrusting-nanotime/).

# Waiting Strategies

Timer Wheel allows you to pick between the three wait strategies: `BusySpin` (most resource-
consuming), although resulting into the best precision. Timer loop will never release control,
and will spin forever waiting for new tasks. `Yielding` strategy is some kind of a compromise,
which yields control after checking whether the deadline was reached or no. `Sleeping` strategy
is injecting a `Thread.sleep()` until the deadline. Moving from "system" timer usually means
you don't want to use `sleep` at all. Except maybe for testing.

# Usage

Library implements `ScheduledExecutorService`. The decision was made to implement this
interface instead of `Timer`, since what the library does has more to do with scheduled
executor service than.

# `debounce` and `throttle`

For convenience, library also provides [debounce](http://rxmarbles.com/#debounce) and throttle for `Runnable`,
`Consumer` and `BiConsumer`, which allow you to wrap any runnable or consumer into
their debounced or throttled version. You can find more information about debouncing
and throttling by following the links above.

# Comparison with JDK ScheduledExecutorService

JDK Timers are great for the majority of cases. Benchmarks show that they're working
stably for "reasonable" amounts of events (tens of thousands).

The following charts show the performance of JDK `ScheduledExecutorService` (violet)
vs `HashedWheelTimer` (black). The X is the amount of tasks submitted sequentially,
the Y axis is the latency until all the tasks were executed.

![Single Timer Benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifesdjeen/hashed-wheel-timer/master/doc/images/single_timer.png)

In the following chart, the Y axis is amount of tasks submitted sequentially, although
from 10 threads, where each next thread is starting with 10 millisecond delay.

![Multi Timer Benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifesdjeen/hashed-wheel-timer/master/doc/images/multi_timer.png)

In both cases, 8 threads are used for workers. Changing amount of threads, hash wheel
size, adding more events to benchmarks doesn't significantly change the picture.

You can see that `HashedWheelTimer` generally gives a flatter curve, which means that given
many fired events, it's precision is going to be better.

All benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/ifesdjeen/hashed-wheel-timer/tree/master/bench).
If you think the benchmarks are suboptimal, incomplete, unrealistic or biased, just
fire an issue. It's always good to learn something new.
